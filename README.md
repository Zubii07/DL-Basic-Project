# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction with Deep Learning


This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to predict Titanic passenger survival. Built with clarity and ease-of-understanding in mind, this walkthrough reflects the tutorial by James Leslie on Kaggle.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- One-hot encoding of categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Title`)
- Pre-processing
- Neural Network architecture with:
  - Input layer based on training features
  - Dense hidden layers with ReLU activation
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Sigmoid output for binary classification
- Training with Adam optimizer and Binary Crossentropy loss
- Evaluation using 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation
